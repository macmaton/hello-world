Self-taught programmer seeking to transition to a new career in web development.

This is an evolving and incomplete list of resources I have used in teaching myself something about programming in general and web development in particular.

Intro to Computer Science
  <br>First in high school in 2006-2007 when I took AP Computer Science in Java.  The most notable project in the course was a program to generate the mandelbrot set, with a GUI interface that I believe used Swing.  Unfortunately this project is lost to the ages, probably accidentally deleted from an old harddrive.
  <br>More recently (2016) I took MIT's 6.00.1x on edX.org using Python to refresh my memory regarding programming and object-oriented concepts.
  
Data Structures and Algorithms (Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 2nd Edition, by Robert Lafore)

Software Construction in Java (MIT 6.005.1x and .2x on edX.org)
  <br>The stated goals of the course were to create software that is safe from bugs, easy to understand, and ready for change.  The focused on testing (using JUnit) and debugging, as well as best practices - DRY, fail fast, avoiding magic numbers, using good names.  The latter half got into concurrency, thread safety, and some networking.
  <br>The [final group project](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/projects/abcplayer/) for this is posted on MIT's OpenCourseWare website.  The project consists of a midi-player for music in a subset of abc notation using ANTLR.  This project is under my repo "probable-potato-player."
 
SQL ([Stanford's Self-Paced Databases course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about))
  <br>I followed the Relational Databases and SQL: Foundations and Practice path, touching on Relational Algebra, Relational Design Theory, Unified Modeling Language (UML), and SQL features including transactions, constraints, triggers, views, and recursion.
  
JSP's and Servlets (course by JavaBrains on Youtube)
  <br>An introduction to the basics of servlets and JSP's using Apache Tomcat.  Configured basic apps using both web.xml and Java class annotation.  Also a primer on JSTL and the MVC pattern.
  
Git (Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub)
  <br>I read chapters 1-3 of Pro Git (Getting Started, Basics, Branching) as well as chapter 5 (Distributed Git) with the goal of better understanding how git works and what it's capable of beyond my use to date of merely backing up my work each day.  I also found this [blog post](https://vincenttunru.com/Spend-effort-on-your-Git-commits/) about making good commits (with useful commit messages) informative.  It also helped me understand how I can break up my work into more meaningful commits.
  
JavaScript ([Mozilla Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide))
<br>Peter Jang has a great Medium article, ([Modern JavaScript Explained for Dinosaurs](https://medium.com/@peterxjang/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70)) about how developing in JavaScript came to be what it is today.  It was a great explanation of how the JavaScript workflow works and what the different tools bring to the table.
  
Introduction to jQuery (Microsoft DEV208x on edX.org)

Spring
  <br>I used JavaBrains' Spring Boot course to learn the basics of setting up a page using Spring Boot.  I'm worked on a web front-end for my abc notation midi player project.

Programming Languages (Coursera course from the University of Washington)
<br>This course introduces language features using languages covering the four quadrants of static vs. dynamic typing and functional vs. object oriented programming.  The instructor assumes prior knowledge of Java, C#, or some other statically typed, object oriented language.  The languages introduced are thus ML (statically typed, functional), Racket (dynamically typed, functional), and Ruby (dynamically typed, object oriented).
